# Customer-Churn
# Telecom Churn Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains information related to customer churn in a telecommunications company. Churn, in this context, refers to customers who have stopped using the company's services. The dataset includes various attributes that may influence customer churn, such as account tenure, contract renewal status, data usage, customer service calls, and more.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is stored in a CSV file named `telecom_churn.csv`. It contains 11 columns and a total of 3,333 rows, each representing a unique customer.

### Columns

1. **Churn**: Indicates whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).
2. **AccountWeeks**: The number of weeks the customer has had an account.
3. **ContractRenewal**: Indicates whether the customer has renewed their contract (1) or not (0).
4. **DataPlan**: Indicates whether the customer has a data plan (1) or not (0).
5. **DataUsage**: The amount of data used by the customer in gigabytes (GB).
6. **CustServCalls**: The number of customer service calls made by the customer.
7. **DayMins**: The total number of minutes the customer used during the day.
8. **DayCalls**: The total number of calls made by the customer during the day.
9. **MonthlyCharge**: The monthly charge incurred by the customer.
10. **OverageFee**: The overage fee incurred by the customer.
11. **RoamMins**: The total number of roaming minutes used by the customer.

## Usage

This dataset can be used for various analytical purposes, including:

- **Predictive Modeling**: Build models to predict customer churn based on the given features.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers based on their usage patterns and other attributes.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identify which features are most influential in predicting churn.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to explore relationships between different features and churn.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Churn Prediction**: Use machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their account tenure, data usage, and customer service interactions.
2. **Customer Retention Strategies**: Analyze the dataset to identify patterns and factors that lead to churn, and develop strategies to retain customers.
3. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Estimate the lifetime value of customers based on their usage patterns and churn probability.

## Data Preprocessing

Before using the dataset for analysis or modeling, consider the following preprocessing steps:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Check for any missing values and decide on an appropriate strategy (e.g., imputation, removal).
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might be more informative, such as the ratio of data usage to monthly charge.
- **Normalization/Scaling**: Normalize or scale numerical features if necessary, especially if using algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables (e.g., `ContractRenewal`, `DataPlan`) into numerical format if needed.
